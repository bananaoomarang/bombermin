Bombermin does not store any user data other than your API key. This application does not have access to your Giant Bomb username, email address, or password, and therefore does not store or transmit this information. Bombermin does not keep a history of your viewing habits, but does transmit your video playback position to Giant Bomb via their API. This is done to keep your playback positions in sync with the site, and is not recorded by the app or used for any other purpose.
